GitHub repository for the M. Celotto, S. Lemke, and S. Panzeri 'Estimating Temporal Evolution of Synaptic Weights from Dynamic Functional Connectivity' (2022) paper.

In this work, we estimated the performance of different functional connectivity matrices in recovering the fixed and dynamic connectivity properties of the Izhikevich recurrent spiking-neural network model.

Source codes for the simulations are in the /code_simulations directory, codes for analyses and plots of the paper figures are in the /code_plot directory.

The scripts have been tested on both Windows and Linux operative system using MATLAB version 2019b or newer.
